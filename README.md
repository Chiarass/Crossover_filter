Repository for a crossover filter circuit laboratory experience.
The experiment was part of the _Laboratorio di Elettromagnetismo_ e Ottica class, by prof. N. Mauri at UniBo.

We built a two-way crossover filter and determined its crossover frequency with different methods.

In the `datiLab2` folder, you'll find all the data that were acquired. All the .C files are ROOT macros used to fit them, as well as the .py file. `correzioneFase.xlsx` is an Excel file which we used to correct the systematic error on phase measurements, whereas `labCircuiti.nb` is a Mathematica file used for computation.
Finally, `Relazione.pdf` is the final report, where you'll find a thorough description of the experiment (in Italian).
